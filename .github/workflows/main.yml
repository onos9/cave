name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows running this workflow manually from the Actions tab

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
